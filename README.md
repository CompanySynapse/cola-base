# ColaCheat Base

This is my simple AntiCheat base for my AntiCheat named ColaChecks. It is set up with 3 Listeners and has a simple builtin movement check.

## Features

- Detects flying and fast movement
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Compatible with Spigot servers

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of ColaCheat from the [releases page](https://github.com/CompanySynapse/cola-base/releases).
2. Put the ColaCheat.jar file in the `plugins` folder of your Spigot server.
3. Restart the server.

## Usage

ColaCheat will automatically start detecting flying and fast movement as soon as the server is started. If a player is detected to be flying or moving too fast, they will be kicked from the server.

## Configuration

There is currently no configuration for ColaCheat.
